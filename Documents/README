To run the code for Matrix outAi.list and Matrix outBi.list you need to edit a few lines in the code. 

The first line is line 15 where the name of the text file is. That's where you put outAi.list. 

The second line to edit is line 74 where the name of the text file is again. You need to put outAi.list there too. 

The third line to edit is line 76 where the name of the other text file is. You need to put outBi.list there 

Then lastly in line 93 where the text file is. You need to put outBi.list as well. 

That is all.
